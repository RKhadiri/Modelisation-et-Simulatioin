# Description of the project

We all know that the importance of the traffic lights is to control the traffic of vehicles on the streets and avenues, however the waiting time may be painful, entering in a street full of traffic lights and arriving at the beginning of a red light every single time, is different than arriving in a green light every time. This issue made us think how we could estimate the best itinerary (if it exists) to take by a driver of a vehicle, and could it really change or help by reducing the impact.

Our project is in two parts, the first one modelizises one traffic light then two, we use two functions, one represents the arriving time, red or green, and the second represents the waiting time with an arriving time as a parameter, these last functions will allow us to calculate the mathematical expected value. In the second part we will simulate multiple vehicles(a thousand) to measure the average of the waiting time, then the Standard Deviation.

As a conclusion, we will try to interpret the results of the simulation.
